This is a hands-on workshop designed to get you started with the programming language Python and the Google Colab notebook environment. We will provide a whirlwind overview of what Python is, why you might want to use it, and how to do so. Then we'll dive into programming basics and discuss:

- Basic **command-line syntax** and using Python in the **terminal**
- Creating and **running** your own Python **scripts**
- The **Anaconda** distribution for data science
- **Jupyer Notebook** and **Google Colab** environments
- What are **variables** and how to use them
- Different **data types** available in Python
- Various **data structures** and how to manipulate them
- What are **functions** and how to write them
- The usage of **loops** and **conditionals**
- The functionalities of various Python **libraries** and how to **import** them

Absolutely no previous programming experience is assumed. This workshop is most suitable for those who have not worked with Python before and are looking to use it for simple scripting and data analysis. Attendees will leave with a strong foundation of basic Python upon which to build more advanced skills.
