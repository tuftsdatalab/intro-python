This is a hands-on workshop designed to introduce you to the wonderful world of programming and get you acquainted with the popular and easy-to-use programming language Python. The workshop is designed to be run in a cloud-computing environment and does not require the installation of any additional software. However, those interested in a desktop experience are welcome to [install the Python 3 version of Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) on their computer and follow along using the corresponding instructions. Current Tufts affiliates can also use the Anaconda installation on the [TTS Virtual Lab](https://vdi.it.tufts.edu/).

Note that this workshop is intended for use in a live instructor-guided session. However, the interactive notebook included in [Part 2](#part-2) is also suitable for self-guided study. Please check the [Data Lab workshop schedule](https://sites.tufts.edu/datalab/workshops/) for upcoming live offerings of this workshop.

## Workshop Schedule

1. [Working with Python on the Command Line](#part-1)
2. [Using an Interactive Notebook Environment](#part-2)

## Part 1: Working with Python on the Command Line {#part-1}

<a href="https://console.python.org/python-dot-org-console/console_frame/" target="_blank" onClick="window.open('https://console.python.org/python-dot-org-console/console_frame/','pagename','resizable,height=315,width=745'); return false;">**Click here**</a> to launch an online version of the command-line based Python interpreter.

If you have Anaconda installed, follow the instructions below to launch a locally hosted Python interpreter.

1. Launch **Terminal** (*macOS/Linux*) or the **Anaconda PowerShell Prompt** (*Windows*).
    - **Windows**: *Start > Anaconda3 > Anaconda PowerShell Prompt*
    - **macOS**: *Applications > Utilities > Terminal*
2. Type `python` and press **Enter/Return**.

## Part 2: Using an Interactive Notebook Environment {#part-2}
[![Launch Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tuftsdatalab/intro-python/master?urlpath=lab){:target="_blank"}&nbsp;
[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tuftsdatalab/intro-python/blob/master/intro-python.ipynb){:target="_blank"}&nbsp;
[![Download Notebook](https://tuftsdatalab.github.io/assets/badges/jupyter.svg)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tuftsdatalab/intro-python/intro-python.ipynb)

Follow the instructions below to launch an online version of the [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) interface pre-configured for this workshop.
1. Click on the [**Launch Binder**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tuftsdatalab/intro-python/master?urlpath=lab){:target="_blank"} button above.
2. A Binder instance will launch in a new tab with the message *Starting Repository*.
3. Wait patiently and do not close the Binder tab. After a few minutes, a JupyterLab instance will launch.
4. To open the workshop notebook, *double-click* on **intro-python.ipynb** in the file browser on the left.

Alternatively, you may click on the [**Open in Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tuftsdatalab/intro-python/blob/master/intro-python.ipynb){:target="_blank"} button above to launch the workshop notebook in the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) interactive Python notebook environment. Note that a Google account is required to run notebooks in Google Colab.

If you have Anaconda installed, follow the instructions below to launch a locally hosted JupyterLab environment.

1. Click on the [**Download Notebook**](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tuftsdatalab/intro-python/intro-python.ipynb) button above to download the workshop notebook. It is reccomended you create a designated folder for this workshop and move the notebook there.
2. Launch JupyterLab either from the **command line** or via **Anaconda Navigator**.
    - From the **command line**:
        1. Launch **Terminal** (*macOS/Linux*) or the **Anaconda PowerShell Prompt** (*Windows*).
            - **Windows**: *Start > Anaconda3 > Anaconda PowerShell Prompt*
            - **macOS**: *Applications > Utilities > Terminal*
        2. Type `jupyter lab` and press **Enter/Return**.
    - Using **Anaconda Navigator**:
        1. Launch Anaconda Navigator via the Start Menu (*Windows*) or from Applications (*macOS*).
            - **Windows**: *Start > Anaconda3 > Anaconda Navigator*
            - **macOS**: *Applications > Utilities > Terminal*
        2. Launch **JupyterLab** using the corresponding *Launch* button.
3. JupyterLab will open in a web browser. (A new tab will be generated if a browser is already open.)
4. Within the JupyterLab file explorer on the left, navigate to the location of the downloaded **intro-python.ipynb** notebook.
5. Once you are in the correct directory, *double-click* on **intro-python.ipynb** in the file browser to open the workshop notebook.
